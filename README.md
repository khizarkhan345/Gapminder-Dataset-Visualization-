# Gapminder-Dataset-Visualization-
There is a common myth by the people that the world is divided in to two groups the western countries group which is considered a rich one 
and a developing world group which considered a poor countries group. I am going to use the gapminder dataset and answer whether this view by
the people is still true. 

Gapminder is a dataset about the world health and economics. 
I have used the ggplot2 library of R language and answered various questions. 

In this small case study, I have answered the following two questions by using the gapminder dataset.
 
1)	Is it fair to say that the world is divided into the western rich nations and the developing world in Africa, Asia and Latin America?
2)	Has income inequality across countries worsened during the last forty years? 

I have written a complete report about my analysis and visualization. Please, refer to word document for complete details.
